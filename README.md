# Research Data Processing Scripts (Showcase)

This repository showcases a collection of Python utility scripts developed for tasks often encountered when working with longitudinal research study data (e.g., from clinical trials). Tasks include **calculating schedule adherence metrics (like missed or late/early tests),** processing data, comparing data sources for validation, and performing various data quality checks.

## Scripts Included

* **`calculate_test_deviations.py`**: Calculates missed/late/early test counts based on participant status and schedule. Adds results as new columns to the data file.
* **`validate_deviation_counts.py`**: Verifies the counts generated by `calculate_test_deviations.py`.
* **`compare_data_sources.py`**: Compares baseline/EOS data between CSV group files and an Excel file. Reports discrepancies.
* **`cross_source_data_validation.py`**: Performs detailed cross-source validation (CSV vs Excel) based on configured mappings. Reports discrepancies.
* **`validate_event_structure.py`**: Checks internal data consistency (event presence, order, date/result pairs) within one file against an expected sequence.
* **`check_status_vs_data_entry.py`**: Finds participants with specific statuses but missing all key date entries, flagging them for potential review.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Data cleaning and preparation using Pandas.
* Date/time manipulation (`datetime`, `relativedelta`).
* Implementing study-specific logic (schedules, status rules).
* Cross-file data comparison and validation (CSV, Excel).
* Internal data structure and consistency checks.
* Configuration management via script constants.

## Configuration Approach

Each script is designed with configurability in mind. Key parameters are defined as constants near the top of each `.py` file. This allows adaptation to different study structures by modifying elements such as:

* Input/output file paths and sheet names.
* Column names mapping to participant IDs, event names, dates, status, results, etc.
* Study-specific event name lists or schedules.
* Calculation parameters (e.g., grace periods, status codes).

*The values present in the scripts are generic placeholders used for demonstration purposes and would require modification for use with specific datasets.*
